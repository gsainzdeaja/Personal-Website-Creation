# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Markdown Instructions


This is a Markdown file. All written documents that you will submit this semester will be Markdown files. Markdown is a commonly used format by developers and bloggers. It's something that you should know. Learning it is a learning objective of this course.

**Please use the official [Markdown Reference Documentation](https://commonmark.org/help/) if you aren't sure how to "code" Markdown.**

This is an example for inserting images into Markdown:

## Personal Site (Milestone 1)

### Website Topic (Milestone 1)
The main objective of the website is getting people to know me, both my personal and academic/professional lifes, that includes my family, my university, my hobbies, friends, experiences... I see it as an extensive, deeper, and of course, more personal version of my CV.


### Device (Milestone 1)
Given my audience, and the topic of my website, I find desktop   websites to be more appropiate.

## Personal Website Design Exploration (Milestone 1)

Identify three personal websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include a screenshot of the home page for each site. If you're planning a mobile website, your screenshots should be from a mobile website. If you're planning a desktop website, your screenshots should be from a desktop website.

### Personal Website 1 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the personal website you identified above. (1-2 paragraphs)
>
> - Who do you think this site is designed for? Who is its intended audience?

    I believe Diego's website is designed for a similar audience to the one I intend to approach with my website. He includes a list of projects he has worked on on the past, his profesional experience, but also his personal hobbies, therefore, I see the site to be designed for coworkers/professors/random people looking for partners to work with in projects on coding. Also, he intends to show his personal hobbies such as running, but I dont think his objective is to attract people from outside the professional field.

> - What **goals** do you think the audience likely has when visiting this site.

Following the same line of though, I think they would like to find a new project partner/ research assistant... Or maybe some recruiters searching for new employees in the field of coding.

> - What **content** is included?

He includes text, link to his social media accoutns and his email, images of hisself, logos of the softwares he uses, logos of social media platforms...

> - Do you believe the content likely **addresses** the goals of the site's audience?

I believe he does, since he gives extra information about himself for people who would like to know more. Also, the timeline he uses to show his experience is a great tool to address audience goals.

> - What do you like about the design?

I like two things on top of everything.
      1) How the homepage is not overwelming and has just the right amount of text to guide the audience through the website.
      2) The timeline he uses to explain his past professional experience in a cronological order.

> - Is the site designed for desktop, mobile, or desktop and mobile devices?

It is designed both for desktop and mobile devices.

website reflection/critique:

I would include more photos in the website. First, I would update the profile picture to be a more elegant one. Secondly, for each activity, hobbie, or experience he has in the timeline, he could make it even more visual with videos or pictures of himself while practising them.


### Personal Website 2 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the personal website you identified above. (1-2 paragraphs)
>
> - Who do you think this site is designed for? Who is its intended audience?

In this case, the site creator, Sean, didnt exclusevly itend to create a website to sell himself to the world for professional projects. On the contrary, I see it more like a blog where he likes to have his research, his essays, and his collaboration to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain all gathered up in the same place, and to make it accessible for everyone on the cloud.

> - What **goals** do you think the audience likely has when visiting this site.

In this case, the potential audience would be people willing to know more about blockain and cryptocurrencies. However, it can also attend an audience willing to find talent in the field.

> - What **content** is included?

He includes a lot of text, pictures, graphs, links, logos.

> - Do you believe the content likely **addresses** the goals of the site's audience?

I think it does address the goals of the site's audience given how he knos what pages to use more text and complements the text with key graphics and comments from professional partners.

> - What do you like about the design?

In the blog page, I like the way he divides his different essays, also, he inserts a picture on top of each of them to make it more attractive for the audience to enter.

> - Is the site designed for desktop, mobile, or desktop and mobile devices?

It is desgined for desktop devices only.


### Personal Website 3 Review (Milestone 1)
> Review the personal website you identified above. (1-2 paragraphs)
>
> - Who do you think this site is designed for? Who is its intended audience?

 In my opinion, Joel's objective for the website is to have an extra way to attract more people to the company he founded "Impossible", with the intention of showing who he is for people to land in the companies website from a different begining point. Therefore, the website is designed for athletes who would like to make a living of their passion by becoming entrepreneurs just like Joel did.

> - What **goals** do you think the audience likely has when visiting this site.

The main goal of people visiting Joel's audience is to find how an athlete could find a living out of their hobbie or sport by becoming an entrepeuner, and find inspiration.

> - What **content** is included?

In the website, he uses text, pictures, links to external resources.

> - Do you believe the content likely **addresses** the goals of the site's audience?

In this case, I do believe he correctly addresses audience's goals, since he jumps up strong in the landing page with an image of himself in the back, which shows how athletic the guy is, and will fore sure catch his audience attention. Also, the site is attractive and easy to move around.

> - What do you like about the design?

The design is pretty great, I like how in the home page he makes a contrast between himself(name and big picture), with the name of his own brand in the middle of the screen. Also, the easy access to his newsletter is key.

> - Is the site designed for desktop, mobile, or desktop and mobile devices?

Both desktop and mobile devices.


## Audience & Goals (Milestone 1)



### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain who the intended audience is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site's topic.

My website's Audience:

Recruiters, students, or individuals whose main objective is to find people to work with them, either in their company or as a coworker for a project/research. Researcher or individuals working on projects in the filed of data science or investment banking / Cornell professors interested in finding help for their research.

### Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Why would your audience visit your site?
> Identify at least 3 goals that your users have for visiting your website.

1. People that are familiar with one of the two sides of my life (professional/personal), and are intrigued to know about the other side.

2. Coworkers, or students from my university that dont yet know me as a person, but would like to approach me for some reason (that might be to see if I fit as a partner for a project they are working in). Their objective would be to get a first insight and to have a basis to decide whether I am the kind of person they are looking for. This objective may include students/professors...

3. The final, and probably most important audience of my website, are those people who dont yet know anything about me and I would personally like them to take a look into my website. That is people I would like to work/partner with both for professional projects or for personal matters such as hobbies/friendship/trips.... Therefore this would be people who visit my website to see if I match their selection criteria.


## Content Planning (Milestone 1)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 1)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your personal website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

    - Text
    - Images
    - A download to my CV
    - Link to my social accounts (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter)



### Content Justification (Milestone 1)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

The Images, as I will explain later on in the home page description are basic for the website to attract its audience visually from the moment the land in the site. I will use not only images of myself, but also logos of the instituions I belong to, the sport clubs I support, the hobbies that I have, my professional interests...
Then, text will be used to describe the influence of all the pictures above in my life, and what my duties are within each of those.

Also, text will be used to include a section called PROJECTS to explain the projects I have been part of, those that I intend to develop in the near future, and projects I am currently working on. This section is key for the group of people who will land in my page either to look for a coworker/assistant, or for recruiters looking for people to employ.

I will include a download bottom to my CV for those who would like to know more in detail about my professional experience.
Finally, links to my social media can be attractive to my audience, especially for those looking to get to know my personal life.


### Home Page Content (Milestone 1)
> What is the content that your users would expect when visiting your site for the first time.
>
> Briefly identify what content you will include on the homepage and why this content should be the first thing your target audience sees when they visit your site.

I would like my website to be engaging to the audience from the first look they take into it. For that reason, I need to have an attractive homepage that wakes up the curiosity of the audience to know more about me. To achieve that, I believe I need just the right amount of text that wont result overwhelming for the incoming user, but also that it doesn't lack of the essential information.

Images will be key to attract the audience. Most likely I will include a professional picture of myself in one side, and a picture of me either with friends, or doing sports... in the other side. I find this last part to be essential to attract the 3 groups of my audience, since humans always respond quicker to images and short sentences or key words than to a whole piece of text.

Finally, I will include little pictures representing the logos of instutions that I belong to, or of those that I am really interested in such as the universities that I've been to and the sport clubs that I support.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

For milestone 2, you will design the information architecture for all the pages your website.

You may change your homepage content based on your card sorting. If you do change the homepage content, don't update it above, just include the new plan in the section below (Content Organization).

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

photos and explanations of each iteration

ITERATION ONE:

![All cards in first iteration](images/../../Images/cs1.jpeg)
![Sorted cards in first iteration](images/../../Images/cs2.jpeg))

In this Iteration, I decided to create many different webpages, nearly one for every two pieces of content that I wanted to include.

ITERATION TWO:

![All cards in second iteration](images/../../Images/cs11.jpeg)
![Sorted cards in second iteration](images/../../Images/cs22.jpeg))

In this iteration, I decided to join Education and working experience in the same webpage. Also, I included contact information in the home page. And finally, putting sports and other hobbies all together.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

I will use iteration number 2.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

Starting at the homepage, I believe having too much text can result over welming. However I decided to include my contact information links inside of it for the user to easily contact me if needed. Furthermore, Having education and Work experience in different webpages did not make much sense as the audience will probably expect to find both things in the same page given the similarity of the two. Finally, iI included sports under the hobbies page to not give it too much relevance in my website.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

-page 1: Home Page
-page 2: About Me
-page 3: Background
-page 4: Hobbies
-page 5: To achieve list

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

In my opinion, webpages names have to be concrete and right to the point, however be engaging at the same time. I believe I pretty much included the main words for the audience to feel attracted by the webpage.

## Visual Themes (Milestone 3)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

### Theme Ideas (Milestone 3)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.

Professional Theme: The first Idea I had was to set the background colour to black, and only use white and brown for the text in the website as means to make it more professional and less attractive to distractions. Targeted to recruiters and audience intrested in the professional me.

Personal Theme: The second theme that came through my mind was to make it more friendly and less professional, by using lighter colours.Targeted to coworkers, friends interested in the personal me.

In between Theme: Finally, the last option was to go neutral so that I can attack both kind of audiences with the same website theme.


### Final Theme (Milestone 3)
> Which theme did you select as your final theme? Why?

Finally I decided to not go with the professional theme, nor the friendly theme, since I did not want some of my audience to lose attention or to missjudge my website. Therefore, I decided to go for a neutral look, by using normal colours, whites, blacks greens and blues.

### Theme Rationale (Milestone 3)
> Discuss your final theme design: how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?

In my opinion, the final theme that I decided to go for fits perfectly the needs and goals of my audience. The colours are neutraly sitauted in between professional and personal, which is the intention. Then, the headings and sections, are distinguished boht in terms of colours as in terms of typography and size. Finally, the borders I gave to secondary headings will make the audience always know the section and webpage where they are in the website.

> Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions were you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?

The intention is to convey a desire in my audience's minds for wanting to discover more about me, while not only thinking of me academically or professionaly, but making them see both sides of me to complement what they have come to the website to look for.

## Layout & Composition (Final Submission)

### Home Page Layout (Final Submission)
> Include several sketches of possible layout ideas for the home page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea.
> Show your design process.
> **Use the example websites above as inspiration for your site's design.**

First Two ideas for design website.
In teh first one, the main idea was to center the content both vertically and horizontally, and make the moepage a page of contact information rather than a welcome page. Given the specific and small atractivity of the first idea, I decided to include some pictures both on top and below the content. The sketcehs are the following:

![Sketches 1 and 2 for homepage](images/../../Images/Homepage1_2.jpg)

Finally, I decided that it did not make sense to have a different structure in the home page to the rest of the webpages, therefore, I decided to get rid of the vertical centralization that I was using, and attached the header to the top of the page. Also, I decided to include 3 ppictures and put the contact information at the bottom. This is how the final layout would look like:

![Final Sketch for homepage](images/../../Images/homepage_Def.jpg)




### Final Site Design (Final Submission)
> Include a sketch of the final layout for each page in your site.
> Provide an explanation below each sketch.

![Final Sketch for About me page](images/../../Images/aboutme.jpg)

In this page, I decided to include little text, and to center the two images included at the bottom of the page, to make it visual but at the same time keeping it simple.

![Final Sketch for Background page](images/../../Images/background.jpg)

In the background page, I wanted to divide the content in sections, and I used different titles and colours for each section. Also, I included centered and inline images for each sector.

![Final Sketch for To achive list page](images/../../Images/toachieve.jpg)

Finally, for the to achieve list, I wanted to make it simple and short, keeping it in less than one box of text, and including only one big picture for the audience to get a good las impression of the website.



### Static Website Design Check (Final Submission)
> We're building a static website without interactivity.
> **No part of your website may dynamically change.**
> Examples of dynamic behavior are dropdown menus, hamburger menus, popups, modals/lightboxes, image carousels, etc.
>dfd
> Audit your design and check that you aren't relying on any dynamic features.

My website design is completely static given that it doesnt include any of the above mentioned elements. The navigation bar is statitic, so is the rest of the content.


## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs a few paragraphs (1-2). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during the design process and how you addressed them.

**All images must be visible in "Markdown: Open Preview" for credit!**

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Audience (Final Submission)
> A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.

Identifying the audience has been one of the hardest and most time consuming duties i faced while creating the website. At the begining, I had the intention of targeting three different and specific groups of people, because I wanted my website to be accesible and attractive both for people who wanted to get to know me professionaly, and those whose intention was to know the personal me.

In the end, I decided to focus in an specific kind of audience which could be described as:
"Any, person, no matter his background or the reason why he/she knows me, who wants to know more about me"

While targeting this group, I am no longer targetting recruiters, or coworkers, I just want to have a place in the internet where people can know more about some of the most important aspects of my life.


### Design Goals (Final Submission)
> An explanation of the design goals for that audience, based on your earlier rationales.

The audience would like to observe a webpage that doesnt fail to be very professional, but at the same time doesnt go too fancy. THy would expect a lot of images and big descriptions of the same. Finally, soft colours to make the website welcoming and comfortable for their eyes are expected.


### Content Organization & Navigation (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final content organization and navigation met your goals and why it's appropriate for your audience.

According to the audience that I described before, their main objectives/goals and desired takeaways when visiting my website could be any of the following, or all of them:

-To have contact information about me, in case they want to reach out to me either through social media, email, or even a phone call.
-To get a more deep look into my personal life and hobbies.
-To discover what places I have studied in, and the companys I have worked for.
-I also included a Resume download option, for those who, after discovering about me, would like to take an even deeper look into my professinal life.

For this reason, I believe all the following content is appropiate for my audience: Contact information in the homepage, Small description of myself in the about me page, complete background both in terms of education and working experience as well as languages in background page, hobbies and entertainment in hobbies page, and a final future steps brief explanation of myself. Finally, throughout all the pages I included several picture of myself and of the institutions and places I have worked and been to respectively, to bring the audience more into my life and give them a feeling of them getting to know me deeper.

### Visual Design (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final design met your goals and why it's appropriate for your audience.

To complete this section appropiately, I would like to start describing the reason for the index/home page to be as it is, and in the end, give a general insight as of why the design meets the audience goals.

First of all, in the index webpage, I decided to center the content horizontally, so that it will catch the audience's attention right away, and for them to rapidly see the navigation bar and surf around my website. Also, including the links for contact inside of the logos and icons of the different social media chanels seems more appealing for the audience I am approaching, and looks more attractive and fun, being the latter a key emotion I would like the audience to feel.

Now, for the general design of the rest of the webpages, which all follow a similar structure. I would like to highlight the fact that I always use colours and borders to make jerarqy remarkable, and not only the size of the text. Moreover, I created conteiners for some images as to make them appear in line thus not occupying so much space in the audience's desktop.

Finally, for the last submission I decided to bring the background color to white. Since I believe it matches better with my personality, and, at the end of the day, the main objective of creating this website is for the audience to meet the real me.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

I really appreciate and value this section being in the assigment itself. We dont always are concious of how much we learn given the progressive growth we have, and the lack of perspective. However, looking back, not mroe than a month ago I closely did not even knwo what css was, and would have never imagined I would be able to create a real website. It has been a beautiful journey, and of course, and entertaining, fun, and challenging one.
