      <h2>Sports</h2>


      <p>Since I was a child I have been practising sports!!<p>

      <p>Big and IMPORTANT portion of my life.</p>

      <p>I specially love to do sports in groups: Football, Basketball, padel, CrossFit... AND, YES, Cross Fit is better than Gym.</p>

      <p>Also love to practice Ski, and tennis among others! </p>

      <h4>TEAMS I SUPPORT </h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Football: REAL MADRID </li>
        <LI>Basketball: San Pablo Burgos in the ACB and Boston Celtics in the NBA</LI>
        <LI>Of course I always support my national team in all sports</LI>
      </ul>

      <p>Among other things, working, playing and competing in teams have teached me a lot.
      For me this is enough to know that whatever I do and Wherever I may go, I will always try to be close to the world of sports.</p>

    <h2>FRIENDS and GIRLFRIEND</h2>
    <p>I really dont like being alone, so I love to share all my hobbies either with friends, family, or my girlfriend.
    </p>
    <p>Last summer, I did many trips with both my group of friends from Burgos, my home town, and those I met at university in Madrid. </p>
    <p>We went to the beach in the north of Spain, and later to a festival in Madrid, and we had lots of fun!!!</p>
