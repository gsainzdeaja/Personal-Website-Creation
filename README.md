# Personal Website

During my exchange program at Cornell University, I had the opportunity to take a course on web desing and development. This one here is the first project that I created in the course. It consists of a personal website in which I have different pages describing both my acadamic and my personal life.

In the repository I have included the html, css and javascript files as well as a design-journey document in which I walk you through the design process of the website.
